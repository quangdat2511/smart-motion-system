## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quangdat2511/real-estate-marketplace.git
```

### 2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA

### 3. Set the Java language level

- Go to `File > Project Structure` (or press `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S`)
- Under the **Project** tab:
  - Set **Language level** to: `8 - Lambdas, type annotations, etc.`
  - Set **Project SDK** to: `corretto-1.8 Amazon Corretto 1.8.0_452`

> This ensures the project uses Java 8, which is compatible with the source code and prevents issues such as missing `javax.xml.bind` classes found in later Java versions.

### 4. Configure the MySQL database

- Open the file `database/insert_database.sql`, copy its contents, and run it in your MySQL DBMS.
- Update the `application.properties` file with your own MySQL credentials:
  ```properties
  spring.datasource.username=your_username
  spring.datasource.password=your_password
  ```

3. In the **Server** tab, click **Configure...** and set the path to your local **Tomcat 8.5.34** installation
4. Switch to the **Deployment** tab
5. Click the `+` button → choose `spring-boot:war exploded` (recommended)
6. Click on Application context and leave it empty
7. Make sure the HTTP port is set to `8080`
8. Click **OK** to save the configuration

> If you don't have Tomcat installed, download version 8.5.34 from: [https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi)
